                <p>All elephant have several distinctive features, the most notable of which is a long trunk or proboscis, used for many purposes, particularly breathing,lifting water and grasping objects. their inscisors grow into tunks, which can serve as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. Elephants large ear flaps help to control their body temperature. their pillar-like legs can carry their great weight. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs while Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs</p>
                <p>Elephants are herbivorous and can be found in different habitants including Savannahs, forests, deserts and marshes. they prefer to stay near water.</p>
